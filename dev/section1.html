    <h1>1</h1>
    <h2>Day One</h2>
<p>Marshal Josiah da Silva examined his face in the small wash-mirror. It was a broad, lined face, with clear grey eyes looking out from above a bushy moustache. The moustache was in the Portuguese style, with great drooping ends, the only thing left to him by his conquistador ancestors.<br />
Using quick, precise motions, he wet his cheeks and began to shave the night’s stubble clean, working around the carefully-groomed moustache. The train rocked as he did so, causing his blade to bite briefly into the soft skin below his jaw. A drop of blood welled up from the tiny cut.<br />
“Careful,” the man behind him said in a slow, mocking drawl.<br />
With an irritated glance, Josiah looked at the man who shared his small room on the train. The fellow was built like a knife, tall and lean, with muscles like whipcords and a face hard and cold as death itself. He was chained hand and foot.<br />
Josiah’s eyes flicked to the manacles restraining the man’s wrists and ankles, quickly checking their sureness before he returned to his grooming. The sun was rising through the window to the east, and rays of golden light shot into the cabin briefly as the train came around a curve. Outside the window, the sunburnt lands of the west stretched out wide and open before them.<br />
Josiah used a handkerchief to mop up the dot of blood, inspecting the cut. It was a tiny thing, already done bleeding. He mopped it one more time and returned to his shaving.<br />
As he opened his mouth to respond, the train rocked again—this time his blade was safely in the washbasin—and the door to the tiny bedroom compartment opened.<br />
“Fairfield, next stop,” the conductor said, smiling in the doorway. His face fell as his eyes landed on the man in chains. The prisoner leered up at him, his jackknife face split in a wide, mirthless grin. With a quick motion the prisoner lurched forward slightly, shaking his chains.<br />
The conductor scowled, taking an involuntary step back. To the marshal, he said, “Here now, you sure this one’s gonna be arright?”<br />
“Don’t worry. He’ll hang soon enough,” the marshal said in a cultured, southern accent, wiping his now-bare chin clean.<br />
The conductor closed the door, grumbling, and Josiah could feel the train slowing as it approached its next stop. He shrugged on his suit jacket and smoothed the fine, grey cloth, looking at himself in the mirror.<br />
He turned to his prisoner.</p>
<p>“Time to go. You have one chance to come along peaceably,” Josiah said. <a href="25">Turn to 25</a>.<br />
Josiah grabbed the prisoner’s chains and hefted him to his feet. <a href="13">Turn to 13</a>.</p>
