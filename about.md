Hey there! I am a passionate product manager with full stack development and usability experience. I am fascinated by the boundaries of new mediums and permanently look for opportunities to connect technologies in new ways.

I grew up in London, England and Holywood, Northern Ireland. I studied at St. John's College, Cambridge and the University of Manchester , where I graduated in Computer Science. In Summer 2010 I moved to the SF Bay Area and live with my wife Jennifer and two children.
